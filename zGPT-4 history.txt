Sure, let's get started!

1. **Player eliminates all aliens:** 

    First, you need to check if there are any aliens left in the game. You already have the check in the `S3N71N3L` class's `check_condition` method. If all aliens are eliminated, the 'level_end' event is triggered. This event is already being handled in the `G4M3` class's `handle_event` method. You can add a new level start here:

    In `G4M3.py`, modify `handle_event` method:

2. **Aliens reach the player:** 

    We need to add a check in `S3N71N3L` class's `check_condition` method. If any alien's y-coordinate is greater than or equal to the player's y-coordinate, the 'game_over' event is triggered:

    In `S3N71N3L.py`, modify `check_condition` method:

3. **Player has no more lives:** 

    For this, you'll need to add a lives attribute to the `PL4Y3R` class, decrement it when the player is hit, and trigger a 'game_over' event when lives reach zero:

    In `PL4Y3R.py`, add lives attribute and a method to decrease lives:

    In `G4M3.py`, decrease player's lives when an alien reaches the player:

    Make sure to also handle the 'game_over' event in the `G4M3` class's `handle_event` method. We already have handling code for this event there, so no additional code is required.

Remember, these are basic implementations and you might need to adjust them according to your game logic or add more complexity. For example, you might want to add a delay before starting a new level, or add a condition that an alien has to collide with the player to decrease the player's lives.
