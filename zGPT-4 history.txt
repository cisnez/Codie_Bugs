Sure, let's get started!

1. **Player eliminates all aliens:** 

    First, you need to check if there are any aliens left in the game. You already have the check in the `S3N71N3L` class's `check_condition` method. If all aliens are eliminated, the 'level_end' event is triggered. This event is already being handled in the `G4M3` class's `handle_event` method. You can add a new level start here:

    In `G4M3.py`, modify `handle_event` method:

2. **Aliens reach the player:** 

    We need to add a check in `S3N71N3L` class's `check_condition` method. If any alien's y-coordinate is greater than or equal to the player's y-coordinate, the 'game_over' event is triggered:

    In `S3N71N3L.py`, modify `check_condition` method:

3. **Player has no more lives:** 

    For this, you'll need to add a lives attribute to the `PL4Y3R` class, decrement it when the player is hit, and trigger a 'game_over' event when lives reach zero:

    In `PL4Y3R.py`, add lives attribute and a method to decrease lives:

    In `G4M3.py`, decrease player's lives when an alien reaches the player:

    Make sure to also handle the 'game_over' event in the `G4M3` class's `handle_event` method. We already have handling code for this event there, so no additional code is required.

Remember, these are basic implementations and you might need to adjust them according to your game logic or add more complexity. For example, you might want to add a delay before starting a new level, or add a condition that an alien has to collide with the player to decrease the player's lives.

Looking at your code, the aliens would stop moving because of a logical error in the `update_game_state` method of the `G4M3` class. When you calculate the `rightmost_alien_x` and `leftmost_alien_x`, it can lead to a situation where all the aliens have been eliminated and these variables are undefined. This is also the reason you were getting a ValueError before. To fix this, you need to add a check to see if there are any aliens left before trying to calculate the rightmost and leftmost alien's x-coordinate. 

To clear all the bullets when a new level starts, you can simply set `self.bullets` to an empty list in the `start_new_level` method.

Here is the modified code:

Please note that while this code removes bullets and moves aliens, there is still no check for when bullets leave the screen or for when aliens collide with the player. These are things you might want to add in the future.

You have some redundant code in your update_game_state method. The code for moving aliens and changing their direction is repeated twice. You also need to add a check to see if there are any aliens left before trying to calculate the rightmost and leftmost alien's x-coordinate.
Let's correct that:

This code is now checking whether there are any aliens before attempting to update their positions. It also only checks once for the condition to change the direction of the aliens. Additionally, if any alien reaches the player's level on the screen, the player's lives are decreased. Finally, bullets are moved and checked for collisions with aliens. If a bullet collides with an alien, both are removed from their respective lists.

Please replace your existing update_game_state method with this corrected version.
