Kick-off for Next Session:
In our next session, we can start by reviewing the game's current status and identifying any areas that need improvement. We could consider adding new features, such as power-ups, more complex enemy movements, or a scoring system. Alternatively, we could focus on polishing existing features, improving the game's visuals, or optimizing the code. Let's also plan to playtest the game regularly to ensure that all features work as expected and that the game is fun to play.
