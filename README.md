# Codie_Bugs

Codie_Bugs is an educational Python project developed in collaboration with GPT-4. The main aim of the project is to design and implement a basic game structure using listeners, messages, events, sentinels, and triggers. We are following principles of object-oriented programming to create a simple space-invaders-style game where a player can move and shoot bullets at aliens. The game is built using Pygame, a set of Python modules designed for writing video games, which simplifies the process by providing prebuilt libraries for game development.

## Project Structure

```
/Codie_Bugs
|-- __init__.py
|-- G4M3.py                    # Main game loop
|-- G4M3Object.py              # Parent class for game objects
|-- B453Object.py              # Base class for all objects, includes methods for event handling
|
|-- /_1M6_                     # Images
|   |-- alien_monster.jpg
|
|-- /EN717135                  # Entities
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- AL13N.py               # Alien class
|   |-- BULL37.py              # Bullet class
|   |-- PL4Y3R.py              # Player class
|
|-- /TR1663R                   # Triggers
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- S3N71N3L.py            # Sentinel class for level end and game over conditions
|
```

The project has a clear entry point (`G4M3.py`), and organizes related files into their respective directories (Entities and Triggers). The `__init__.py` files are required for Python to treat these directories as packages. In the simplest case, `__init__.py` can be an empty file.

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Player Controls:** Add keyboard controls to allow the player to move and shoot bullets.

2. **Add Bullet Movement and Collision Detection:** Bullets should continue moving upwards after being shot. They should also disappear upon hitting an alien or leaving the game screen.

3. **Improve Game Dynamics:** Improve the collision detection mechanism and consider adding more game features, such as multiple levels, different alien types, power-ups, and more.

4. **Add Graphics:** Currently, the game uses basic shapes for representation. Adding images for the player, bullets, and aliens would enhance the visual appeal.

5. **Optimize Performance:** As the game's complexity increases, performance optimization might become necessary to maintain smooth gameplay.

6. **Add Sound Effects and Music:** Enhance the game's interactivity and engagement with sound effects and background music.

7. **Implement a Scoring System:** Introduce points for hitting aliens, displaying the current score, high score, and other relevant statistics.

8. **Create a Menu System:** Add a start screen, options screen, pause screen, etc., to improve the game's navigability and user experience.

9. **Refactor the Code:** As the project evolves, the code may need refactoring to keep it clean, maintainable, and efficient.

Remember, learning programming is a gradual process. Take your time, experiment, read, and learn at your own pace. Happy coding!
