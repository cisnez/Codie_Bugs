# If a Sentinel is used as a trigger safety, it would essentially act as a guard condition before a certain action or event can be triggered. Let's consider an `end_of_level` Sentinel as an example.
# In the context of a Space Invaders game, you might have a S3N71N3L object that represents `end_of_level`. This Sentinel could trigger the end-of-level event only when certain conditions are met, such as all :alien_monster:\S being eliminated.
