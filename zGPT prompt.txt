**Also, if you're interested in more advanced programming patterns, you could consider looking into the observer pattern or the publish-subscribe pattern, both of which are widely used in event-driven programming.**

**Current status:**
The game ends when three lives are lost. 

Here are the class files and descriptions:

```#G4M3.py
# This is the main Game class that manages the overall game. It initializes the game, creates and manages all game objects, handles user input, updates the game state, and defines the conditions for the game to end.

# Note: This Game class has a Sentinel as an attribute. It creates a new Sentinel when a level starts and defines the condition that must be met for the play to end.

# The event processing loop is located in the run() method of the G4M3 class:

```

```
#B453Object.py
# Base Object Class: Parent class for all game objects, encapsulating common behaviors such as adding, removing, and triggering events.

```

```
#G4M3Object.py
# Extends the Base Object class and acts as a parent class for specific game entities like the Player, Alien, and Bullet.

```

```
#EV3N7.py
# Event Class: Represents an event that can be triggered during the game, such as a player losing a life or an alien being hit.

```

```
#S3N71N3L.py
# Sentinel Class: Extends the BaseObject class and monitors the game state, triggering specific events when certain conditions are met.

```

```
#AL13N.py
# Alien Class: Represents an alien in the game, handling its movements, collisions, and interactions with other game objects.

```

```
#BULL37.py
# Bullet Class: Represents a bullet fired by the player, controlling its movement and handling its interactions with other game objects.

```

```
#PL4Y3R.py
# Player Class: Represents the player character, managing its movements, shots, and interactions with other game objects.
